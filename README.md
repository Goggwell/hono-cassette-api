# Cassette Beasts API with Cloudflare Workers + KV

Tried this as an experiment to compare with the main API I made (found [here](https://github.com/Goggwell/cassette-beasts-api)), and based on my findings, it seems to work quite well!

On average, the Koyeb/Render.com deployments took `400ms` to wait for the server response, whereas the Cloudflare Worker deployment took `95ms`!

May proceed with this version in the future!
